## Description

[My Coffee Corner](https://mycoffeecorner.netlify.app/) is a blog about the world of coffee that I made for my Project Exam during my first year of Front-End Development at Noroff.

Additionally, JavaScript was incorporated to enhance interactivity, and content was fetched from a WordPress REST API.
